Question 1: Do we need to use threading or something similar for the controller?
            
            - if so: how can we efficiently handle sending a Pong as well as reading the data sent from the bots
              as they both come from the same socket

Question 2: If not, how do I handle the socket recv if I'm waiting for a command from the user 
            (the Ping will not receive a Pong and will time out)
            
            - will only work if bots exist and send a response, otherwise recv is stuck waiting
